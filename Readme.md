Overview of Diabetes Prediction Using Neural Networks: 
This project uses a neural network model to predict the onset of diabetes based on multiple health metrics. The model is built and trained using TensorFlow/Keras, and it achieves a test accuracy of approximately 77%. 
Features of the dataset used in this project include:
Pregnancies
Glucose
BloodPressure
SkinThickness
Insulin
BMI
DiabetesPedigreeFunction 
Age
